Repository of importi.ca, Maria McGuckian's art import website

Maria is an 'art importer'. Maria works with artist she has discovered around the world to make their work accessible in Canada. Maria works with Designers, Decorators, and the like; developing an understanding for what their client requires and then commissioning a piece to be done by one of the artists found on this site to meet the client's exact needs. This site is intended as a 'viewbook' of past works to get an understanding of what has been done in the past. 

For me, this site was an exercise, aimed at developing a basic understanding of Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap. It is not heavily customized, as you can probably tell. Although Jekyll, as a blog-oriented generator, was not exactly meant for this use, it provided a good platform to build a dynamic and scalable website which can grow easily as Maria's client and artist base expand.
