		<p>Discovering Art has been a passion of mine since traveling to several destinations around the world and bringing art home to share with others. There are many true artists that bring shape, form and colour in a unique way that opens your home & office to the world of ‘Imported’ Art.</p>
		<p>Each piece is worked on by dedicated and extremely talented artists from around the world, and brings a story to every piece that you can proudly share with friends, families and clients alike.</p>
		<p>I am bringing you the first of these artists, that will enlighten you with the art of capturing movement in sports, and custom made to your favourite sports person and position that they are remembered by.  Throwing that winning goal into the basket, hitting the perfect puck, kicking the ball to the greatest heights.</p>
